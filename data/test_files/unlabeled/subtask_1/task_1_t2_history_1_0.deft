 2128 . Although marked by great topographic , linguistic , and cultural diversity , this region cradled a number of civilizations with similar characteristics .
 Mesoamericans were polytheistic ; their gods possessed both male and female traits and demanded blood sacrifices of enemies taken in battle or ritual bloodletting .
 Corn , or maize , domesticated by 5000 BCE , formed the basis of their diet .
 2137 . These intensely religious migrants dreamed of creating communities of reformed Protestantism where the corruption of England would be eliminated .
 One of the first groups of Puritans to move to North America , known as Pilgrims and led by William Bradford , had originally left England to live in the Netherlands .
 Fearing their children were losing their English identity among the Dutch , however , they sailed for North America in 1620 to settle at Plymouth , the first English settlement in New England .
 2161 . In 1610 , Spanish settlers established themselves at Santa Fe — originally named La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de Asís , or “ Royal City of the Holy Faith of St. Francis of Assisi ” — where many Pueblo villages were located .
 Santa Fe became the capital of the Kingdom of New Mexico , an outpost of the larger Spanish Viceroyalty of New Spain , which had its headquarters in Mexico City .
 As they had in other Spanish colonies , Franciscan missionaries labored to bring about a spiritual conquest by converting the Pueblo to Catholicism .
 At first , the Pueblo adopted the parts of Catholicism that dovetailed with their own long - standing view of the world .

 2242 . The British would turn over the frontier posts in the Northwest , American ships would be allowed to trade freely in the West Indies , and the United States agreed to assemble a commission charged with settling colonial debts U.S. citizens owed British merchants .
 The treaty did not address the important issue of impressment , however — the British navy ’s practice of forcing or “ impressing ” American sailors to work and fight on British warships .
 Jay ’s Treaty led the Spanish , who worried that it signaled an alliance between the United States and Great Britain , to negotiate a treaty of their own — Pinckney ’s Treaty — that allowed American commerce to flow through the Spanish port of New Orleans .
