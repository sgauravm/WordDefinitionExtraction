 625 . For all of these reasons , pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms .
 Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche .
 Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment ( [ link ] ) .
 634 . Hybrids can be either less fit than the parents , more fit , or about the same .
 Usually hybrids tend to be less fit ; therefore , such reproduction diminishes over time , nudging the two species to diverge further in a process called reinforcement .
 This term is used because the low success of the hybrids reinforces the original speciation .
 763 . Fossilized microbial mats represent the earliest record of life on Earth .
 A stromatolite is a sedimentary structure formed when minerals are precipitated out of water by prokaryotes in a microbial mat ( [ link ] ) .
 Stromatolites form layered rocks made of carbonate or silicate .
 784 . Prokaryotes can use different sources of energy to assemble macromolecules from smaller molecules .
 Phototrophs ( or phototrophic organisms ) obtain their energy from sunlight .
 Chemotrophs ( or chemosynthetic organisms ) obtain their energy from chemical compounds .
 817 . Some dinoflagellates generate light , called bioluminescence , when they are jarred or stressed .
 Large numbers of marine dinoflagellates ( billions or trillions of cells per wave ) can emit light and cause an entire breaking wave to twinkle or take on a brilliant blue color ( [ link ] ) .
 823 . Some fungal organisms multiply only asexually , whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction with alternation of generations .
 Most fungi produce a large number of spores , which are haploid cells that can undergo mitosis to form multicellular , haploid individuals .
 Like bacteria , fungi play an essential role in ecosystems because they are decomposers and participate in the cycling of nutrients by breaking down organic materials to simple molecules .
 Fungi often interact with other organisms , forming beneficial or mutualistic associations .
 850 . Most members live on land , with a few aquatic exceptions .
 They form visible mycelia with a fuzzy appearance and are commonly known as mold . Reproduction of the fungi in this group is strictly asexual and occurs mostly by production of asexual conidiospores ( [ link ] ) .
 Some hyphae may recombine and form heterokaryotic hyphae .
