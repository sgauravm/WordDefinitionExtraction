 1569 . An exoskeleton is an external skeleton that consists of a hard encasement on the surface of an organism .
 For example , the shells of crabs and insects are exoskeletons ( [ link ] ) .
 1602 . The bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue .
 There is no cavity , or space , present between the bones and so most fibrous joints do not move at all , or are only capable of minor movements .
 1617 . Straightening a limb after flexion is an example of extension .
 Extension past the regular anatomical position is referred to as hyperextension .
 This includes moving the neck back to look upward , or bending the wrist so that the hand moves away from the forearm .
 1626 . Protraction is the anterior movement of a bone in the horizontal plane .
 Retraction occurs as a joint moves back into position after protraction .
 Protraction and retraction can be seen in the movement of the mandible as the jaw is thrust outwards and then back inwards .
