 2948 . Drawings using lines to represent electric fields around charged objects are very useful in visualizing field strength and direction .
 Since the electric field has both magnitude and direction , it is a vector .
 2966 . In the first stage of the xerography process , the conducting aluminum drum is grounded so that a negative charge is induced under the thin layer of uniformly positively charged selenium .
 In the second stage , the surface of the drum is exposed to the image of whatever is to be copied .
 2972 . A capacitor is a device used to store electric charge .
 Capacitors have applications ranging from filtering static out of radio reception to energy storage in heart defibrillators .
 3008 . There is a variety of so - called ohmmeters that purport to measure resistance .
 What the most common ohmmeters actually do is to apply a voltage to a resistance , measure the current , and calculate the resistance using Ohm â€™s law .
 3119 . An interesting thing happens if you pass light through a large number of evenly spaced parallel slits , called a diffraction grating .
 An interference pattern is created that is very similar to the one formed by a double slit ( see [ link ] ) .
 3140 . Rest energy is
