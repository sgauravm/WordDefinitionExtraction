 6723 . The increasing public political role of the first lady continued in the 1980s with Nancy Reagan ’s “ Just Say No ” antidrug campaign and in the early 1990s with Barbara Bush ’s efforts on behalf of literacy .
 The public role of the first lady reach a new level with Hillary Clinton in the 1990s when her husband put her in charge of his efforts to achieve health care reform , a controversial decision that did not meet with political success .

 In the years leading up to the 2015 ruling that same - sex couples have a right to marry in all fifty states , marriage equality had become a key civil rights issue for the LGBT community , as demonstrated at Seattle ’s 2012 Pride parade ( right ) .

 6792 . When a vacancy occurs in a lower federal court , by custom , the president consults with that state ’s U.S. senators before making a nomination .

 In fact , in response to tax rate increases , many states have placed legal or constitutional limits on regional governments ’ ability to raise property taxes .

 This citizen - driven initiative capped the real estate tax at 1 percent of the cash value of property and stopped the practice of reassessing properties for tax purposes whenever a home in the neighborhood was sold .
 “ What is Proposition 13 ? ” http://www.californiataxdata.com/pdf/Prop13.pdf ( March 14 , 2016 ) .

 At the other end of the spectrum is a free trade approach , in which a country allows the unfettered flow of goods and services between itself and other countries .
