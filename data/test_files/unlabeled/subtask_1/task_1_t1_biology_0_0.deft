 26 . Living things are highly organized and structured , following a hierarchy that can be examined on a scale from small to large .
 The atom is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter .
 It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons .
 47 . At its most fundamental level , life is made up of matter .
 Matter is any substance that occupies space and has mass .
 Elements are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that can not be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions .
 65 . Electron Orbitals
 Although useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain elements , the Bohr model of the atom does not accurately reflect how electrons are spatially distributed surrounding the nucleus .
 They do not circle the nucleus like the earth orbits the sun , but are found in electron orbitals .
 These relatively complex shapes result from the fact that electrons behave not just like particles , but also like waves .
 101 . An acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions ( H+ ) in a solution , usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate .
 A base provides either hydroxide ions ( OH – ) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions , reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH .
 In cases where the base releases hydroxide ions , these ions bind to free hydrogen ions , generating new water molecules .
 158 . The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes ; the rRNA of the ribosome also has an enzymatic activity ( peptidyl transferase ) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids .
 Transfer RNA ( tRNA ) is one of the smallest of the four types of RNA , usually 70 – 90 nucleotides long .
 It carries the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis .
 164 . A prokaryote is a simple , mostly single - celled ( unicellular ) organism that lacks a nucleus , or any other membrane - bound organelle .
 We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes .
 179 . Vesicles and vacuoles are membrane - bound sacs that function in storage and transport .
 Other than the fact that vacuoles are somewhat larger than vesicles , there is a very subtle distinction between them : The membranes of vesicles can fuse with either the plasma membrane or other membrane systems within the cell .
