Direct action also took such forms as the sit - in campaigns to desegregate lunch counters that began in Greensboro , North Carolina , in 1960 , and the 1961 Freedom Rides in which black and white volunteers rode buses and trains through the South to enforce a 1946 Supreme Court decision that desegregated interstate transportation ( Morgan v.

 Morgan v. Virginia , 328 U.S. 373 ( 1946 ) .
 While such focused campaigns could be effective , they often had little impact in places where they were not replicated .
 In addition , some of the campaigns led to violence against both the campaigns ’ leaders and ordinary people ; Rosa Parks , a longtime NAACP member and graduate of the Highlander Folk School for civil rights activists , whose actions had begun the Montgomery boycott , received death threats , E. D. Nixon ’s home was bombed , and the Freedom Riders were attacked in Alabama .

 This university matched Cruz ’s conservative and religious ideological leanings and was intended to give him a boost from the faith - based community .
 6264 . Conservative governments attempt to hold tight to the traditions of a nation by balancing individual rights with the good of the community .
 Traditional conservatism supports the authority of the monarchy and the church , believing government provides the rule of law and maintains a society that is safe and organized .
 Modern conservatism differs from traditional conservatism in assuming elected government will guard individual liberties and provide laws .
 6294 . Important political opinion leaders , or political elites , also shape public opinion , usually by serving as short - term cues that help voters pay closer attention to a political debate and make decisions about it .
