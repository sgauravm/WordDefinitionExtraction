 1951 . The spring and fall turnover is a seasonal process that recycles nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater ecosystem to the top of a body of water ( [ link ] ) .
 These turnovers are caused by the formation of a thermocline : a layer of water with a temperature that is significantly different from that of the surrounding layers .
 In wintertime , the surface of lakes found in many northern regions is frozen .
 1999 . This model also allows for the population of a negative population growth , or a population decline .
 This occurs when the number of individuals in the population exceeds the carrying capacity ( because the value of ( K - N ) / K is negative ) .
 A graph of this equation yields an S - shaped curve ( [ link ] ) , and it is a more realistic model of population growth than exponential growth .
 There are three different sections to an S - shaped curve .
 2035 . Aggressive displays are also common in the animal kingdom .
 An example is when a dog bares its teeth when it wants another dog to back down .
 2059 . Equilibrium is the steady state of an ecosystem where all organisms are in balance with their environment and with each other .
 In ecology , two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems : resistance and resilience .
 2065 . In many ecosystems , the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms ( plants and/or phytoplankton ) , which are called primary producers .
 The organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores : the primary consumers .
 Secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers .
 2080 . For example , in the English Channel ecosystem the primary producers account for a biomass of 4 g / m2 ( grams per meter squared ) , while the primary consumers exhibit a biomass of 21 g / m2 .
 The productivity of the primary producers is especially important in any ecosystem because these organisms bring energy to other living organisms by photoautotrophy or chemoautotrophy .
 The rate at which photosynthetic primary producers incorporate energy from the sun is called gross primary productivity .
 An example of gross primary productivity is shown in the compartment diagram of energy flow within the Silver Springs aquatic ecosystem as shown ( [ link ] ) .
