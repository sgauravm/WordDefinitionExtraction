 3652 . In addition to maintaining balance , the vestibular system collects information critical for controlling movement and the reflexes that move various parts of our bodies to compensate for changes in body position .
 Therefore , both proprioception ( perception of body position ) and kinesthesia ( perception of the body ’s movement through space ) interact with information provided by the vestibular system .
 3655 . Another Gestalt principle for organizing sensory stimuli into meaningful perception is proximity .
 This principle asserts that things that are close to one another tend to be grouped together , as [ link ] illustrates .
 3664 . They tend to be simpler than instincts , involve the activity of specific body parts and systems ( e.g. , the knee - jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light ) , and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system ( e.g. , the spinal cord and the medulla ) .
 In contrast , instincts are innate behaviors that are triggered by a broader range of events , such as aging and the change of seasons .
 They are more complex patterns of behavior , involve movement of the organism as a whole ( e.g. , sexual activity and migration ) , and involve higher brain centers .
 3676 . Now that you know how classical conditioning works and have seen several examples , let ’s take a look at some of the general processes involved .
 In classical conditioning , the initial period of learning is known as acquisition , when an organism learns to connect a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus .
 During acquisition , the neutral stimulus begins to elicit the conditioned response , and eventually the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus capable of eliciting the conditioned response by itself .
 3745 . THEORIES ABOUT MOTIVATION William James ( 1842 – 1910 ) was an important contributor to early research into motivation , and he is often referred to as the father of psychology in the United States .
 James theorized that behavior was driven by a number of instincts , which aid survival ( [ link ] ) .
 3751 . Self - efficacy is an individual ’s belief in her own capability to complete a task , which may include a previous successful completion of the exact task or a similar task .
 Albert Bandura ( 1994 ) theorized that an individual ’s sense of self - efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior .
 Bandura argues that motivation derives from expectations that we have about the consequences of our behaviors , and ultimately , it is the appreciation of our capacity to engage in a given behavior that will determine what we do and the future goals that we set for ourselves .
 3754 . You use crystallized intelligence all the time in your coursework by demonstrating that you have mastered the information covered in the course .
 Fluid intelligence encompasses the ability to see complex relationships and solve problems .
 Navigating your way home after being detoured onto an unfamiliar route because of road construction would draw upon your fluid intelligence .
 3763 . Creativity is often assessed as a function of one ’s ability to engage in divergent thinking .
 Divergent thinking can be described as thinking “ outside the box ; ” it allows an individual to arrive at unique , multiple solutions to a given problem .
 3805 . The James - Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotions arise from physiological arousal .
 Recall what you have learned about the sympathetic nervous system and our fight or flight response when threatened .
 3823 . Sigmund Freud ( 1856 – 1939 ) is probably the most controversial and misunderstood psychological theorist .
 When reading Freud ’s theories , it is important to remember that he was a medical doctor , not a psychologist .
 3826 . Through social interactions with parents and others in a child ’s environment , the ego and superego develop to help control the i d .
 The superego develops as a child interacts with others , learning the social rules for right and wrong .
 The superego acts as our conscience ; it is our moral compass that tells us how we should behave .
 3832 . In the above example , Joe made fun of a homosexual peer while himself being attracted to males .
 In regression , an individual acts much younger than their age .
 For example , a four - year - old child who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle .
