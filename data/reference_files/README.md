# Understanding the Reference Files

These reference files are used in the Codalab pipeline for evaluation purposes. When you submit your predictions via Codalab, these are the exact files that the scoring program evaluates your submission against. 

If you are receiving errors from the scoring program about mismatched lines, incorrect number of lines, or other formatting problems with your submission, you may want to check your submission files against these "gold" files.

Please note that each of these reference .zip files contain gold files for all subtasks. Evaluation should run successfully regardless of how many subtasks you wish to submit at once, as long as you submit all files in that particular submission phase for that particular subtask.
